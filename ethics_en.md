# CODE OF ETHICS

## FLORIDA, MARCH 1, 2024

## STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

The purpose of creating a code of ethics is to establish an "iter"—that is, a path or roadmap designed to help RACHA users operate within the legal framework of multilevel marketing. Transparency in actions and respect in commercial distribution relationships are the principles that guide this document. Therefore, before embarking on your journey to success with your business in RACHA, please carefully read and understand the desirable practices for conducting your business from now on.

If you have any questions you wish to clarify, or if you intend to send suggestions about the code of ethics and its procedures, we have a communication channel available that enables personalized and timely contact with the entrepreneur. You can email us at: `info@racha.network`, which will be reviewed and answered as soon as possible. We recommend that each email include the user's RACHA identification (ID) in the "subject" line.

## A) CONTENT OF THE CODE OF ETHICS

This manual contains a series of simple and easily understandable recommendations regarding the behavior that users should adopt in their interactions within the RACHA business network. Interpersonal relationships are one of the keys to success in this business, which is precisely why we present to the user our beliefs and the attitudes they should adopt when doing business with RACHA.

## B) ABOUT RACHA

RACHA is an ambitious project made reality. On an international level, its mission is to generate real rewards and distribute them equitably among participants, supported by STT, which acts as a seal and guarantor of quality throughout the process.

In this business model, all revenues are distributed as follows: 60% is allocated to the PARTNER who decides to participate in the business model by purchasing the company’s payment commitment contracts called "PARTICIPATIONS", while 40% goes to RACHA. This latter percentage is distributed among the validated team of distributors and affiliates (28.8%), with the remainder covering the organization’s human and operational expenses (11.2%). It is important to note that the distribution occurs once a specific percentage of the total value of customer participations is reached. The model and percentages may be modified over time for security, business development, or other reasons; in such cases, RACHA will communicate the changes in a timely and appropriate manner through company channels.

## C) RACHA USER ETHICS

We believe that the success of all users depends on their ability to trade the products and opportunities that our business model offers. This must be done in a positive and honest way. Likewise, we respect the business activities of all entrepreneurs but do not agree with users who misrepresent RACHA’s model and philosophy unfairly or unrealistically.

We aim to establish an international code of good commercial practices, guiding all of us to:

I. Protect the reputation of RACHA and its products and brands.  
II. Avoid any behavior that may harm the reputation of RACHA, its products, and brands. Encourage actions that enhance RACHA’s reputation.  
III. Be professional in conducting business and treat other independent distributors, clients, and RACHA users with respect and courtesy at all times.  
IV. Refrain from any misleading, false, rude, disloyal, unethical, or immoral behavior. Always act with honesty, respect, loyalty, and ethics, maintaining a transparent and courteous demeanor aligned with RACHA’s values.  
V. Respect the honest efforts of other independent distributors and refrain from unethical recruiting practices.

## D) ETHICAL OBLIGATIONS OF RACHA USERS

The contractual documents that make up RACHA’s business model are intended to protect users and the company from any adverse consequences resulting from business activities. In the event of non-compliance or behavior contrary to the terms, RACHA may terminate the user’s contract to protect other distributors and the company itself.

**NON-COMPETITION:** RACHA users must avoid any personal business that constitutes or may constitute a conflict of interest with RACHA’s business activities.

A person or entity may be part of another direct sales company and register as a RACHA user as long as there is no conflict of interest.

**CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:** During the term of the RACHA user contract, all genealogical and downline reports, consumer lists (including credit, consumer/distributor profiles, purchase information), manufacturer and supplier information, commercial reports, bonus and sales reports, and any other financial or commercial information that the company deems confidential are the exclusive property of RACHA.

**DUTY OF CONFIDENTIALITY:** By signing the RACHA user contract, the user agrees to maintain complete secrecy and confidentiality regarding proprietary information, business data, or any information and documents received during RACHA-related activities.

## E) INFORMATION ABOUT THE DOWNLINE

Information about a user’s downline is available in the *Virtual Office*. Access is secured through login and password. All information is legally confidential and will be treated in compliance with GDPR principles.

## F) RACHA'S TRADE SECRETS

RACHA’s business relationships with manufacturers, vendors, suppliers, and partners are confidential and restricted.

## G) UNFAIR COMPETITION

All users are prohibited from engaging in behavior that violates laws regarding unfair competition.

## H) PROTECTING RACHA'S IMAGE

Users must always protect RACHA’s image, products, and brands, ensuring that these products are presented professionally and in appropriate settings. Users may use RACHA’s trademarks and brand names on stationery, business cards, or letterhead, but must not distort the approved logos available on the website [https://racha.network/](https://racha.network/)

All promotional materials containing the RACHA brand and name must be pre-approved by RACHA.

It is prohibited to use any publications that expressly or implicitly claim income from selling or promoting RACHA’s products or services.

## I) USE OF EMAIL FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES

Using email for business activities to distribute spam or any type of unsolicited email is prohibited, including but not limited to:

- Mass emails.  
- Unauthorized promotional posts in newsgroups.

Creating email accounts with the word RACHA in the address (e.g., AM RACHA) is not allowed.

RACHA does not allow users to present or display its products at trade shows or conventions without prior consent from the corporate team.

## K) ADVERTISING AND INTERNET USE

RACHA allows users to promote the business opportunity online provided they strictly comply with this code of ethics. Any online use of trademarks, logos, or other intellectual property must follow the guidelines in this manual and be pre-approved by RACHA.

RACHA will regularly audit published materials and may immediately terminate a user’s contract for violations, requiring the violator to compensate RACHA for damages.

It is strictly forbidden to use content that is pornographic, racist, offensive, political, religious, or discriminatory. If such content is detected, the user’s contract will be immediately terminated, and the violator must compensate RACHA for any damage caused.

To protect its brand, RACHA prohibits any use of its trademarks in any form within website URLs or domain names.

Users intending to register domains to promote the business model must obtain written authorization from RACHA.

## L) PROFIT STATEMENTS AND COMPENSATION PLAN DISCLOSURE

RACHA users must describe the compensation plan truthfully and fairly. No false or misleading statements may be made to prospective users to encourage registration.

Users may not guarantee earnings or estimate expenses for prospective users.

RACHA’s compensation plan may only be explained using the materials published on its website ([https://racha.network/](https://racha.network/)). Therefore, all users must be informed that success comes through effort, dedication, resources, and time invested in the business.

## M) TERMINATION OF USER CONTRACT FOR ETHICAL VIOLATIONS

A user's RACHA contract may be terminated if the user violates its terms or this code of ethics. Termination will be formally communicated to the user by mail sent to the address provided in their contract.

Upon termination:

- The user must permanently stop using RACHA trademarks, names, signs, posters, or any promotional material related to RACHA’s products, plans, or programs.  
- The user must stop publicly identifying as a RACHA user.  
- The user loses all rights related to RACHA activities, including but not limited to titles, downlines, and future bonuses from the compensation plan.

Downline users sponsored by the terminated user will be transferred to the next upline, who becomes their new personal sponsor.

## N) AMENDMENTS TO RACHA’S POLICIES

RACHA reserves the right to modify the user contract, this code of ethics, product prices, marketing materials, and/or compensation plan without prior notice and at any time.

Any changes will be communicated to distributors through available channels (email, website [https://racha.network/](https://racha.network/), or by written correspondence). These amendments become binding for all distributors from the date of publication.

In the event of any conflict between the amendment and the terms of the distributor contract, code of ethics, or other documents, the amendment shall prevail.

## O) PUBLIC APPEARANCES AND PRESS CONTACT

RACHA’s official spokesperson is the only authorized person to communicate with the press about RACHA’s business model.

If a user wishes to speak to the press, they must obtain written authorization from the official spokesperson.

RACHA is committed to enforcing this Code of Ethics among its users.

Users must always comply with:

- The rules and procedures described in this manual.  
- The applicable laws in each location and at any given time.
