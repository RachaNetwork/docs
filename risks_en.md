The participant account holder, by signing this agreement, expressly acknowledges having clear, conscious, and transparent knowledge of all the information provided by RACHA (AM RACHA) through its publication on its website (https://racha.network/), regarding the risks inherent to investments in cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets, in compliance with current applicable legislation.  

Likewise, the participant account holder acknowledges having read and understood the complete information relating to the risks of investments in cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets available at the following link:

Without prejudice to the above provisions, the participant account holder acknowledges that investments in cryptocurrencies or crypto-assets involve the following risks:  

## Regulatory Risks:  

There is currently no regulatory framework in the European Union or Latin America governing crypto-assets such as Bitcoin that provides guarantees and protections comparable to those applicable to financial products. At the European level, negotiations are ongoing for a Regulation (known as MiCA) aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for the issuance of crypto-assets and service providers related to these.  

## Legal Considerations Regarding Cryptocurrencies:  

Cryptocurrencies do not constitute legal tender.  

They are not backed by a central bank or other public authorities and are not covered by client protection mechanisms such as the Deposit Guarantee Fund or the Investor Guarantee Fund.  

It is estimated that there are over 7,000 cryptocurrencies in the market with characteristics similar to Bitcoin. These are complex instruments that may not be suitable for small investors, whose prices carry a high speculative component that could even result in the total loss of the investment.  

Additionally, leveraged derivative products linked to cryptocurrencies allow indirect investments therein, further increasing their complexity and the possibility of incurring losses exceeding the initial investment, thus requiring substantial knowledge and experience.  

## Risks Arising from Price Formation of Cryptocurrencies and Crypto-Assets and Their Liquidity:  

Cryptocurrency prices are formed in the absence of effective mechanisms preventing manipulation, unlike those present in regulated securities markets. Frequently, prices are also formed without being supported by publicly available information.  

Regarding liquidity-related risks, it must be noted that many cryptocurrencies may lack sufficient liquidity to liquidate an investment without suffering significant losses, particularly due to their limited circulation among retail and institutional investors.  

## Risks Associated with the Use of Crypto-Assets as a Means of Payment:  

Despite having existed for over a decade, the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment remains very limited, contrasting with other digital developments that have achieved widespread adoption in much shorter periods. It is important to emphasize that there is no obligation to accept Bitcoin or any other crypto-asset as a means of payment for debts or other obligations. The MiCA Regulation does not foresee a change in this regard.  

Furthermore, due to their high volatility, cryptocurrencies inadequately fulfill the functions of unit of account and store of value.  

## Risks Arising from the Cross-Border Nature of Crypto Activities:  

In many instances, the various actors involved in the issuance, custody, and marketing of crypto-assets are not located in Spain or, in some cases, cannot even be located, making the resolution of any disputes potentially costly and outside the jurisdiction of Spanish authorities.  

In summary, by acknowledging the risks inherent to investments in crypto-assets, the participant account holder fully assumes them, releasing RACHA from any liability arising therefrom.
