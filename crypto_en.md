By signing this contract, the participating user expressly declares to clearly, consciously, and transparently know all the information that RACHA (AM RACHA) has provided through its website ([https://racha.network/ ](https://racha.network/ )), regarding the risks inherent to investments in cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets, in compliance with current applicable legislation.

Likewise, the participating user declares to have read and fully understood the complete information related to the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets available at the following link:

Without prejudice to the above, the participating user acknowledges that investments in cryptocurrencies or crypto-assets involve the following risks:

### Risks from a regulatory perspective

There is currently no comprehensive framework in the European Union or Latin America that regulates crypto-assets such as Bitcoin, offering guarantees and protections similar to those applicable to traditional financial products. At the European level, a regulation (known as MiCA â€” Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) is currently being negotiated, aiming to establish a regulatory framework for the issuance of crypto-assets and service providers operating with them.

From a legal standpoint, cryptocurrencies:

- Do not qualify as legal tender.
- Are not backed by a central bank or other public authorities.
- Are not covered by investor protection mechanisms such as the Deposit Guarantee Fund or the Investor Guarantee Fund.

Investments in crypto-assets are high-risk operations due to their high volatility:

It is estimated that there are over 7,000 cryptocurrencies in the market with characteristics similar to Bitcoin. These are complex instruments that may not be suitable for small investors, and whose prices carry a high speculative component that can lead to even total loss of the investment.

Additionally, leveraged derivative products linked to cryptocurrencies allow indirect investment in these assets, which further increases complexity and the risk of suffering losses exceeding the initial investment, requiring significant knowledge and experience.

### Risks derived from price formation and liquidity of cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets

Cryptocurrency prices are formed without effective mechanisms to prevent manipulation, unlike regulated securities markets. In many cases, prices are set without public information supporting them.

Regarding liquidity risks, it must be noted that many cryptocurrencies may lack sufficient liquidity to exit an investment without suffering significant losses, especially due to their limited circulation among retail and professional investors.

### Risks associated with the use of crypto-assets as a means of payment

Despite having existed for over a decade, the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment remains very limited, in contrast to other digital developments that have achieved widespread adoption in much shorter timeframes. It is important to recall that there is no obligation to accept Bitcoin or any other crypto-asset as a means of settling debts or other obligations. The upcoming MiCA regulation does not foresee a change in this matter.

Furthermore, due to their high volatility, cryptocurrencies do not adequately fulfill the functions of unit of account or store of value.

### Risks derived from the cross-border nature of crypto phenomena

In many cases, the different actors involved in the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto-assets are not located in Spain, and in some cases, their location cannot even be determined. Therefore, resolving any disputes could become costly and fall outside the jurisdiction of Spanish authorities.

In summary, by acknowledging the risks inherent to crypto-asset investments, the participating user fully assumes them, releasing RACHA from any liability arising from such risks.
