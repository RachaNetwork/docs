## 1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE PARTIES AND PURPOSE OF THE CONTRACT

These General Terms and Conditions of Contract (hereinafter, the **"Terms"**) regulate the contractual relationship between **RACHA STT LLC**, a limited liability company duly incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida, United States of America (hereinafter, **"RACHA"**), and the natural or legal person who accesses, contracts or uses the product called **RAISE POOL** (hereinafter, the **"User"**).

The purpose of this contract is to regulate the access, acquisition, maintenance, rebalancing, distribution of rewards and withdrawal of digital Participations of the RAISE POOL, as well as the conditions of use of the associated technological services, offered through the RACHA Platform.

---

## 2. EXPRESS ACCEPTANCE AND LEGAL CAPACITY

The acquisition of Participations in the RAISE POOL implies the express, complete and unconditional acceptance of these Terms, which constitute a legally binding contract.

The User declares and guarantees that:

1. Has sufficient legal capacity to contract in accordance with the legislation of their jurisdiction.  
2. Acts in their own name and on their own account, and not as an unauthorized intermediary.  
3. Understands the operation of crypto assets, stablecoins, blockchain and DEFI protocols.  
4. Voluntarily assumes the inherent economic, technological and regulatory risks.

---

## 3. LEGAL NATURE OF RAISE POOL

The RAISE POOL is a decentralized economic participation product, based on the voluntary contribution of stable crypto assets (USDC) to a common pool, whose performance depends on market factors and the internal operations defined by RACHA.

The User expressly acknowledges that the RAISE POOL:

1. Does not constitute a bank deposit or an insured product.  
2. Is not a security, nor a stock, bond, corporate participation or regulated financial instrument.  
3. Does not imply the existence of a promise of fixed or guaranteed return.  
4. Does not generate political, corporate or control rights over RACHA.

---

## 4. ABSENCE OF FINANCIAL ADVICE AND GUARANTEES

RACHA does not act as a financial advisor, broker-dealer, investment advisor, fiduciary or wealth manager.

Any decision to participate in the RAISE POOL is made exclusively by the User, under their own discretion and responsibility.

RACHA does not guarantee:

1. the obtaining of benefits,  
2. the preservation of the contributed capital,  
3. the stability of the value of the Participations,  
4. the frequency or amount of rewards.

---

## 5. DEFINITION AND VALUE OF PARTICIPATIONS

### 5.1. Participations (RV)

Each Participation of the RAISE POOL (hereinafter, **"RV"**) represents a contractual right of economic participation, expressed in accounting terms on the Platform.

The initial reference value of each RV is **10 USDC**, without prejudice to the fact that said value may be modified in the future by RACHA for technical, operational or market reasons.

### 5.2. Minimum purchase

- **Initial minimum purchase:** 500 USDC.  
- Once said threshold is reached, the User may make successive purchases in multiples of the current unit value of the RV.

---

## 6. ACQUISITION AND VALIDATION PROCESS

The acquisition of Participations will be carried out exclusively through the means enabled on the Platform.

The purchase will be considered final and irrevocable once:

- the transaction is confirmed on the corresponding blockchain network,  
- technically verified by RACHA.

The User acknowledges that blockchain transactions are irreversible.

---

## 7. COMMISSIONS AND ASSOCIATED COSTS

### 7.1. Purchase commission

RACHA may apply a purchase commission of **1%** on the total acquisition amount.  
Said commission may be reduced, eliminated or restored during promotional periods.

### 7.2. Commission on rewards

When rewards are transferred directly to the User's wallet, a commission of **1%** will be applied.

This commission will not be applied if the User has automatic compound interest activated.

### 7.3. Withdrawal commission

All withdrawal operations will be subject to a commission of **1%** on the effectively settled amount.

---

## 8. BALANCE AND REBALANCING SYSTEM ("BALANCE & DEAL")

The RAISE POOL incorporates a periodic rebalancing system, called **"Balance & Deal"**, through which the User's balance is adjusted to reflect the real value of the underlying collateral.

Rebalancing will be performed at least once a week, except in exceptional circumstances.

After each rebalancing:

- the accounting value adjusts to **1 RV = 1 USDC**,  
- the number of RVs of the User may increase or decrease proportionally.

The User accepts that rebalancing may imply a reduction in the number of RVs, without this constituting a breach of contract.

---

## 9. DISTRIBUTION OF REWARDS

Rewards derived from the RAISE POOL will be distributed according to the operational criteria defined by RACHA, based on the aggregate performance of the Pool.

The frequency, amount and very existence of rewards is not guaranteed and may vary.

---

## 10. AUTOMATIC COMPOUND INTEREST

The User may activate or deactivate the automatic compound interest function at any time.

When active:

- rewards will be automatically integrated into the User's balance,  
- it will not be necessary to reach the minimum value of one RV,  
- the commission on rewards will not be applied.

---

## 11. WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPATIONS

### 11.1. Right of withdrawal

The User may request the total or partial withdrawal of their balance, provided that the amount exceeds the current minimum (initially, **10 USDC**).

Withdrawal requests will remain pending until the next rebalancing.

### 11.2. Slippage

When requesting withdrawal, the User must choose:

- accept a maximum slippage of **10%** (default option), or  
- accept any negative slippage, without limit.

If slippage exceeds the accepted threshold, the request will be automatically cancelled.

---

## 12. OPERATIONAL EXAMPLES

The examples shown on the Platform or in these Terms are merely illustrative, non-binding and do not constitute a promise of results.

---

## 13. TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF SERVICE

RACHA may temporarily suspend all or part of the service in case of:

- extreme volatility,  
- security risks,  
- technical failures,  
- regulatory requirements,  
- force majeure.

---

## 14. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE, AML/KYC

The User agrees to comply with:

- Bank Secrecy Act,  
- AML/CFT regulations,  
- OFAC regulations,  
- applicable state and federal regulations.

RACHA may require KYC/KYB processes, suspend accounts or block funds in case of non-compliance.

---

1. market fluctuations,  
2. User errors,  
3. blockchain failures,  
4. regulatory changes,  
5. force majeure events.

---

## 16. MODIFICATION OF TERMS

RACHA may modify these Terms at any time.

Modifications will enter into force after their publication on the Platform.

---

## 17. RELATIONAL MARKETING PROGRAM, REFERRALS AND MULTILEVEL STRUCTURE

### 17.1. Nature of the referral program

RACHA may offer, in an accessory and optional manner, a relational marketing and referral program (hereinafter, the **"Program"**), through which certain Users may receive economic incentives for the mere recommendation of the Platform and the RAISE POOL to third parties.

The User expressly acknowledges that:

- The Program has a promotional and accessory character.  
- It does not constitute the main object of the contract nor does it condition participation in the RAISE POOL.

### 17.2. Absence of recruitment obligation

Participation in the RAISE POOL:

- Does not require the recruitment, recommendation or incorporation of new users.  
- Is not conditioned to the existence of a network, team or downstream structure.  
- Does not depend on the performance of third parties.

The User may participate in the RAISE POOL without ever intervening in the referral Program.

### 17.3. Prohibition of remuneration for mere recruitment

RACHA declares, and the User expressly accepts, that:

- There is no remuneration whatsoever for the mere recruitment of people.  
- No incentive is generated exclusively for recruiting or affiliating users.  
- Any reward derived from the Program will be linked to real, verifiable and effective economic activity within the Platform ecosystem.

Consequently, the Program does not constitute:

- a pyramid scheme,  
- a Ponzi scheme,  
- nor an illegal compensation system in accordance with federal or State of Florida legislation.

### 17.4. Conditions of referral incentives

Incentives, if applicable, may be calculated on:

- commissions actually generated,  
- real activity of referred Users,  
- or objective metrics defined on the Platform.

RACHA reserves the right to modify, limit, suspend or eliminate the Program at any time, without affecting the economic rights of the User over their Participations.

### 17.5. User obligations as promoter

The User who participates in the Program undertakes to:

- not make promises of return,  
- not guarantee benefits,  
- not present the RAISE POOL as a safe investment or risk-free,  
- not use deceptive, aggressive or bad faith practices.

Breach of these obligations may result in:

- suspension of the Program,  
- loss of incentives,  
- account cancellation,  
- and, where applicable, claim for damages.

---

## 18. REGULATORY SHIELD AGAINST THE SEC AND LEGAL CLASSIFICATION

### 18.1. Non-qualification as "security" (Howey Test)

The User acknowledges and accepts that their participation in the RAISE POOL does not cumulatively meet the elements of the Howey Test according to U.S. jurisprudence.

### 18.2. Non-existence of investment contract

This contract does not constitute an "investment contract" under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

### 18.3. Application of Reves Test (Family Resemblance)

The Participations of the RAISE POOL are not notes, bonds or debt instruments.

### 18.4. User autonomy and absence of fiduciary management

RACHA does not act as a fiduciary or discretionary asset manager.

### 18.5. Regulatory evolution and adaptation clause

RACHA may modify operations, limit access or adapt the product without generating the right to compensation.

---

## 19. APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION

This contract will be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.

All disputes will be submitted to the competent state or federal courts of Broward County, Florida.
