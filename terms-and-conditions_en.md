## 5. USER'S STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY 

The USER declares having read, understood and accepted in full:

- The complete clauses of this agreement  
- All documents and policies referenced in Clause 1  
- The general and special conditions of the Compensation Plan, which can be accessed via: [https://racha.network/ ](https://racha.network/ )

The USER expressly accepts future modifications of this agreement, as well as other documents referenced in this clause, freely granting explicit consent at this time. These modifications will be communicated via corporate web or official communication channels, with a minimum notice period of 15 days.

The USER begins a legal relationship exclusively with RACHA STT LLC upon signing this contract, whether in person or electronically.


## 6. END USERS: PARTICIPANTS IN POOL ALL-IN 

### 6.1. LEGAL STATUS OF THE USER 

The relationship between RACHA and the USER is based on mutual independence, according to the conditions of this contract, and therefore, for all effects and purposes, including tax-related, there is no employment link or subordination under social jurisdiction.

The USER shall never hold, assume or present himself/herself before third parties as employee, representative or franchisee of RACHA, under penalty of RACHA being able to terminate the contract for cause in case of breach.

RACHA STT LLC does not allow a single user to register and operate more than one account, due to the need to align the business model with anti-money laundering regulations.

### 6.2. PURCHASE OF SHARES 

Each Share represents a contract between the User (henceforth, the "Partner") and the “Pool ALL-IN” (set of businesses and providers of RACHA), granting the right to receive periodic rewards distributed across cycles or reward rounds, according to the number of active shares held.

Participation in RACHA, its services and products implies assuming certain risks: high volatility, regulatory changes, possible smart contract failures, and global movements that may affect the generation of rewards. Under no circumstances does RACHA guarantee financial gains to the USER.

The initial value of each share is set at **50 USDC**.  
Upon purchase, a commission equivalent to **1%** of the total value of shares may be applied, with a maximum limit of **100 USDC per transaction**, intended to cover operational costs associated with acquisition and management.

### 6.3. PAYMENT OF REWARDS 

Rewards are distributed once the threshold of **0.5% of the total value of share purchases** is reached, equivalent to **0.25 USDC per active share**. These rewards are distributed as follows:

- **60% to Partners**, proportionally to the number of active shares they hold.  
- **40% to RACHA**, covering operational costs, business profits and the Referral Program.

### 6.4. PROMOTIONAL SHARES 

RACHA may grant promotional shares when deemed appropriate, provided they do not compromise the balance of the “POOL ALL-IN”. These promotions will be governed by their own terms and conditions where applicable. In absence of specific provisions, these shares will not be redeemable or withdrawable, nor count toward qualification in the Compensation Plan. However, they may generate rewards while active.

RACHA reserves the right to modify, suspend or terminate ongoing promotions at any time, without prior notice, when operational, technical, commercial or legal reasons so dictate.

### 6.5. SHARE REDEMPTION 

Redemption consists of the formal request by the Partner to sell their shares, subject to the following conditions:

#### 6.5.1 Stages of Ownership and Evaluation 

- **Blocked Stage (Cycles 0 to 25):**  
  Sale of shares is not allowed. The Partner may not request redemption during this stage.

- **Limited Stage (Cycles 26 to 100):**  
  Sales are only allowed at original purchase value (50 USDC) or lower, without appreciation recognition.  
  The evaluation will be calculated weekly using the formula: **Current portfolio value ÷ Total active shares**

- **Unlocked Stage (Cycle 101 onward):**  
  Shares can be sold freely at the current market value, higher or lower than the purchase price, applying the previous formula. 100% of accumulated value, including any appreciation, will be recognized.

#### 6.5.2 REDEMPTION PROCEDURE 

Settlement requests will be evaluated and priced weekly during the "Pricing Window", which will take place every Monday from 12:00 to 23:59 hours (Peninsular Spain time).

Any request submitted before the start of the "Pricing Window" will be evaluated during that window, unless it is submitted on a Monday, in which case it will be evaluated during the following Monday's window.

Once the request has been submitted and the Partner's eligibility for the corresponding phase has been verified, the applicable valuation will be communicated to them.

The Partner must explicitly accept this valuation in order for the amount to be credited to their registered wallet within the Application, once accepted and within the timeframe set by the current "Pricing Window".

Transfers of the corresponding amounts will be made within an estimated period of 48 hours. If this deadline cannot be met due to circumstances beyond RACHA’s control, the User will be duly informed.

RACHA reserves the right to carry out a new valuation or even cancel or suspend it if, during the period between the acceptance of the sale price and the actual transfer of assets, any of the circumstances described in clause 6.5.4 should occur.

If the valuation is not accepted, the shares will remain active and continue generating rewards.

#### 6.5.3 WITHDRAWAL DEDUCTION 

According to our stability policy, a deduction of **5%** will be applied to valuations. This deduction is kept within the assets of the “POOL ALL-IN”, protecting the ecosystem and favoring those who choose to stay.

The 5% deduction acts as an internal redistribution mechanism with three clear objectives:
- Cover market fluctuations negatively affecting valuation  
- Reduce internal volatility by keeping capital inside the “POOL ALL-IN”  
- Encourage long-term commitment: redistribution remains in the system, strengthening the position of those who stay  

#### 6.5.4 TEMPORARY SUSPENSION 

RACHA reserves the right to temporarily suspend the redemption process in exceptional situations such as extreme volatility, critical technical updates, security incidents, or urgent regulatory changes, to be communicated through official channels.


## 7. INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS 

### 7.1. LEGAL STATUS OF THE DISTRIBUTOR 

The distributor manages his/her own business, having no employment relation whatsoever with RACHA, being personally responsible for commercial actions, relationships with public administrations, promoting the distribution of the products and services defined in this contract, complying with all rules stated in the Ethics Manual, Compensation Plan, and Anti-Money Laundering document, as well as any other policies published on the web and referenced in clause 1.

For all legal and fiscal purposes, there is no labor link between RACHA and the USER.

### 7.2. MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY 

The USER shall never act as an employee, representative or franchisee of RACHA, under penalty of immediate termination for cause.

The USER declares that, as a distributor of RACHA products and services, he/she is fully independent for all purposes, being solely responsible for paying all expenses required to carry out business activities under this Independent Distributor Agreement.

### 7.3. CONTRACT DURATION 

This contract has an indefinite duration, provided the USER complies with the clauses of this contract, as well as with other documents described in clause fourth.

### 7.4. TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT 

The USER may terminate the distribution contract at any time, provided a **30-day prior written notice** is given via email to **operaciones@racha.network**.

RACHA may terminate the contract in the following cases:

- Breach of any clause  
- Non-compliance with the Ethics Manual  
- Violation of the Anti-Money Laundering document  
- Publishing negative, defamatory or injurious comments about RACHA, its members or administrators, its commercial name and trademark "RACHA (AM RACHA)"  
- Lack of respect toward employees, customers or workers of RACHA  
- Making false, misleading or disproportionate earnings claims regarding the RACHA business model  
- Ignoring communications or improper behavior  
- Any conduct that constitutes a minor or serious offense  

In such cases, the USER will lose all rights derived from the contract, including unpaid commissions.

### 7.5. EFFECTS OF TERMINATION 

Termination of the contract entails definitive loss of all rights, with no entitlement to claim anything from RACHA, nor to continue promoting its products and services.

It is expressly agreed that in the event of termination, the USER will not be entitled to any commission, bonus, or compensation resulting from contractual performance.

### 7.6. ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS 

It is strictly forbidden for the USER to engage in abusive or inappropriate recruitment of other users. RACHA will monitor fair competition among users and take legal action if necessary.

### 7.7. ACTIVITIES SUBJECT TO APPROVAL 

The USER will need prior written approval from RACHA to carry out any of the following activities:

- Advertising RACHA products anywhere and through any means  
- Using RACHA’s commercial names or product names for distribution  
- Using the RACHA (AM RACHA) trademark, logo, symbol or intellectual property  
- Creating or publishing promotional material using RACHA’s official symbols without proper written authorization  

The USER agrees not to register any mark directly or indirectly competing with RACHA trademarks, or any mark or patent that may be confused with them, under penalty of contractual resolution and damages.

### 7.8. INFORMATION FOR DISTRIBUTORS 

The USER will have access to all instructions regarding purchase procedures, sales, profits, commission payments, cancellations, and the compensation plan through [https://racha.network/ ](https://racha.network/ )

Any information or presentation regarding earnings must be based solely on the official compensation plan. RACHA makes no earnings guarantees, nor assumes responsibility for income promises made by users or third parties, since all results depend exclusively on personal effort.

Professional success depends entirely on individual effort, with no guaranteed income, profit or professional achievement.

Compensation is variable and tied solely to successful distribution and promotion of RACHA products to end users. There is no economic or in-kind compensation for promoting the business opportunity of RACHA or sponsoring new users. As a condition to receiving commissions, the USER must focus mainly on selling to non-RACHA network clients.

RACHA never pays its users simply for sponsoring others. The USER must emphasize end-user sales in all business opportunity presentations.

Terms, products, services, commercial schemes and compensation systems of direct marketing companies are not subject to review or prior approval by a public agency.

### 7.9. TRAINING AND RECRUITMENT 

The USER may refer new users within the business plan established by RACHA. In any case, the USER will be responsible for training and monitoring them at their own expense, ensuring their actions follow ethical principles, procedure policies and contractual guidelines, maintaining a constructive relationship among all users.


## 8. SUBSIDIARY LAW

All aspects not covered here will be governed by current civil and commercial laws.


## 9. ADDRESS FOR NOTIFICATIONS

- Email: **operaciones@racha.network**

Personal data collected on our websites will be processed in accordance with Florida data protection laws.

## 11. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE 

By signing these general terms and conditions, the independent distributor recognizes for all legal purposes that:

a) He/she understands that he/she is entering into a legally binding contract composed of this agreement, its clauses, the Procedure Policies, the Compensation Plan, the Anti-Money Laundering document, and the Ethics Manual, and that he/she has read, understood and accepted each of these documents.

b) All information provided to RACHA is accurate and complete.

c) He/she has sufficient legal capacity to enter into contracts and to act as a USER.

d) That the independent distributor is entering into an electronic contract.

As widely known, the electronic contract is perfected once the will declaration of the accepting party is issued via click, without being ignored by the offeror without breaching good faith. Therefore, in consumer contracts entered via internet, under Florida commercial law, there is consent upon manifestation. Thus, the contract is perfected, for example, when completing and accepting the automated purchase form, regardless of the seller confirming reception, which is merely informative. What matters is that the offeror can verify the acceptance: at that moment it will be considered received.

Thus, the legal framework of electronic contracts determines that internet-entered consumer contracts are a species within the category of distance-sold consumer contracts. They may be defined as consumer contracts naturally entered between a provider and a consumer, using exclusively electronic communication and remote interaction, allowing contract formation without simultaneous physical meeting, independently of its object. These are contracts of adherence to pre-set clauses, or simply electronic adhesion contracts, as the user accesses the content published by sellers through the sales portal, observing product description, photos, videos, delivery conditions, vendor location and price, and clicking the "buy" button to finalize the contract, with no possibility of negotiating clauses. That is, the seller sets the entire contractual framework, and the user only has two options: agree or reject.
