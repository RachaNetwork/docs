# Acknowledgment and Signature.-

By signing these general conditions of contracting, the independent distributor acknowledges for all legal purposes that:

a)​ I understand that I am entering into a legally binding contract composed of this contract, its clauses, the Policy of Procedures, the Compensation Plan, the document for the prevention of money laundering, and the Ethics Manual, and that I have read, understood, and accept each of these documents.

b) ​All the information I provide to THE COMPANY is accurate and complete.

c)​ I have sufficient legal capacity to contract and act as a USER.

d).- That the independent distributor is entering into an electronic contract.

As is well known, an electronic contract is perfected once the acceptor's declaration of will is issued by clicking, without it being possible for the offeror to ignore it without acting in bad faith. In this sense, in consumer contracts concluded over the internet, according to Florida commercial legislation, consent exists from the moment acceptance is manifested. Therefore, the contract is perfected, for example, when we complete and accept the automated purchase form, regardless of the offeror's obligation to confirm receipt of acceptance, a confirmation whose value is merely informative and whose absence has no relevance to the perfection of the contract. What is relevant, therefore, is that the offeror can have proof of the acceptance of the offer: at that moment it will be understood that acceptance has been received.

Thus, the legal regime of the electronic contract determines that contracts concluded over the internet are a species within the genus of distance consumer contracts. They can be defined as those consumer contracts that are concluded - naturally, between a supplier and a consumer - mediated 'exclusively' by the use of 'electronic' and 'distance' communication means, so that the conclusion of the contract can take place 'without the simultaneous physical presence' of the contracting parties, 'regardless of its object'. These are contracts concluded by adhesion to pre-drafted general clauses, or simply contracts by electronic adhesion, since the user accesses the content published by sellers through the sales portal, where they observe the product description, photos, videos, delivery conditions, seller's location, and price, among other qualities, having to click the 'buy' button to perfect the contract, without any possibility of discussing the contracting clauses. That is, the selling party is the one who, through the technique of predisposition, formulates all the contractual clauses, before which the user only has two options: to consent according to the clauses stipulated by the seller or not to give their consent, and therefore, not to contract.
