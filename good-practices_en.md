## GOOD PRACTICES INSTRUMENT IN ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING

FLORIDA, MARCH 1, 2024

It is important to note to all natural or legal persons participating in the business model known as RACHA (AM RACHA), that it is imperative that they comply with the entirety of the national and community legislative body on the prevention of money laundering.

To this end, we provide you with this anti-money laundering prevention instrument.

Money laundering can be defined by consensus as a process that basically consists of giving an appearance of legality to assets that originate from criminal activity, making them appear as legally obtained; in other words, it involves incorporating assets obtained through the commission of crimes into legal economic traffic. Similarly, there is agreement in pointing out that, to achieve this objective, the assets go through different phases, with the definition elaborated by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which distinguishes three, being usually accepted.

‚û¢ The first of these, known as substitution or placement, is characterized by the transformation of assets into others in order to avoid suspicion about their origin or to facilitate their handling.

‚û¢ In the second phase, concealment or layering, the aim is to erase the trace of the previous substitution that has taken place.

‚û¢ Finally, when the assets appear totally detached from their illicit origin, we would be in the third stage, which is called reinvestment or integration and in which the assets are incorporated into the legal economic flow. It goes without saying that not all cases of money laundering involve the three stages; nor, when they do occur, do they follow the described sequence. What does seem unquestionable is that the more advanced the legitimizing process, the more difficult its prosecution will be.

Having said the above, it is necessary to emphasize that our independent distributors should be aware of Spanish and Community legislation on the prevention of money laundering:

# Legal Framework for Money Laundering in Florida

The legal framework for money laundering in Florida is outlined in Florida Statute Section 896.101, also known as the Florida Money Laundering Act. This statute classifies money laundering activities based on the amount of money involved and specifies the intent required for a conviction. The law prohibits:

- Financial transactions that promote organized crime
- Transportation of monetary instruments or funds to promote organized crime
- Conducting financial transactions involving the proceeds of unlawful activities

Unlawful activities that commonly generate funds subject to money laundering include white-collar crimes, drug trafficking, cybercrime, and more. Penalties for money laundering in Florida are severe, with consequences escalating based on the amount of money involved in the laundering activities.

Florida‚Äôs approach to penalizing money laundering is structured to reflect the seriousness of the offense, focusing on the amount laundered within a 12-month period. The penalties are categorized as follows:

- **First-degree felony**: Transactions totaling $100,000 or more can carry a prison sentence of up to 30 years.
- **Second-degree felony**: For transactions totaling between $20,000 and $100,000, the offender may face up to 15 years in prison.
- **Third-degree felony**: Transactions exceeding $300 but less than $20,000 can result in up to 5 years of imprisonment.

Beyond imprisonment, those convicted may face hefty fines, which can reach $250,000 or double the value of the amount laundered for a first offense. For subsequent offenses, fines can increase to $500,000 or four times the value of the transaction, whichever is greater. Additionally, a civil penalty of $25,000 or the value of the transactions, whichever is greater, may be imposed.

## üèõÔ∏è Federal Level Regulation

From a Federal perspective, it is important to mention the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, also known as the ‚ÄúBank Secrecy Act‚Äù (BSA), which dates back to the 1970s and was the first benchmark legislation formed to prevent criminals from concealing the origin of criminal proceeds through banks and other financial institutions. The law required financial institutions to cooperate with the government against suspicions of money laundering. The BSA is the most important United States regulation against money laundering. Banks and other financial institutions must ensure that they comply with the obligations implied by the BSA.

The BSA aims to help combat money laundering and ensure that banks and financial institutions are not used as instruments to facilitate it. Under the BSA, entities must detect and monitor potential money laundering activities and report them to the authorities for enforcement action. The legislation also quickly became a tool to track and intercept terrorist financing.

The Bank Secrecy Act is administered by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, which imposes various compliance obligations on financial institutions. To meet these obligations, senior management must ensure that they are thoroughly familiar with the legislation itself.

To achieve BSA compliance, financial institutions must navigate a series of regulatory requirements that focus on reporting to and cooperating with authorities, and creating internal controls against money laundering. This process involves the following important considerations: an Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing compliance program, and reporting and record-keeping requirements.

### üìå AML/CTF Compliance Program

The BSA requires financial institutions to develop an anti-money laundering (AML) program. An effective BSA-AML/CTF compliance program should be tailored to the unique needs of the financial institution it serves, including the risk profile it faces. The main elements of an AML/CFT compliance program are as follows:

- **Internal systems and controls**: An AML/CFT compliance program must be built around a set of written policies and procedures designed to help employees detect and monitor money laundering activities and financial crimes.
- **Compliance Officer**: A senior employee must be appointed to oversee the development and implementation of their institution's program. In addition to overseeing internal controls, the Compliance Officer is responsible for organizing independent audits and reviews of their institutions' AML/CFT compliance program.
- **BSA training**: Basic BSA-AML compliance training should be provided to all employees. Employees with a higher level of responsibility may need advanced training or certification.
- **Independent audits**: A regular schedule of independent audits should be established to verify the ongoing effectiveness of an AML/CFT compliance program. Audits should be conducted by qualified third parties.
- **Information and record keeping**: The BSA entails numerous reporting and filing obligations with FinCen, which relate to specific risk profiles.

These obligations include:

- **Currency Transaction Reports (CTR)**: Currency transaction reports must be filed for cash transactions exceeding US$10,000. This requirement refers only to the physical exchange of currency (cash and paper) between individuals.
- **Form 8300**: Certain businesses, such as car dealerships, art galleries, or insurance companies, that receive more than $10,000 in cash in a single transaction or in multiple related transactions within a 24-hour period, must file Form 8300.
- **Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR)**: Transactions involving suspected BSA violations or terrorist financing activities and totaling US$5,000 or more must be detailed in a suspicious activity report. SARs can be voluntarily filed for suspicious transactions below the US$5,000 threshold.
- **Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR)**: An annual filing requirement for individuals who have accounts in foreign banks totaling US$10,000 or more. While the account holder generally files the FBAR, financial professionals who file the return on behalf of a client must register to file as an institution.

## üîê Common Compliance Systems (KYC Utilities)

Obligated parties should endeavor to establish common systems (centralized or decentralized) for sharing customer due diligence information. These are the so-called ‚ÄúKYC utilities.‚Äù The truth is that current regulations do not establish limitations that imply obstacles to the development of this type of instrument, but the rule offers certainty about its development and operation.

Undoubtedly, the use of these tools seems a fundamental step forward. First, for clients, who will reduce the number of times they have to provide their information to the entities they contract with, facilitating and streamlining processes. But it also, of course, benefits obligated parties by allowing a reduction in the costs associated with obtaining and updating basic due diligence information, and generating greater homogeneity of the data obtained, as well as a more adequate updating process.

However, their implementation will require a significant effort to standardize these due diligence processes for all participants in the common systems that may be created. On the other hand, it seems complex that this type of instrument can replace the individualized approach by entities in relation to customers with a higher than average risk, where the risk appetite of the entities may lead to more disparate control intensities that hinder the homogenization of criteria required by this type of system.

## üßæ Financial Ownership File

On the one hand, the assets subject to declaration are modified. Thus, safe deposit boxes and payment accounts are incorporated, and securities accounts are eliminated. Derived from the above, and specifically from the inclusion of payment accounts, the number of declaring entities is expanded, so that, together with credit institutions, payment institutions and electronic money institutions must also report their clients' payment accounts.

Finally, the access regime is modified, incorporating new authorities and expanding the access capacity of others who already had recognized access (the requirement of prior judicial or fiscal authorization for police access is eliminated). In all cases, however, the restricted purpose for access is maintained: investigation of money laundering and terrorist financing, which is only expanded in the case of actions for the prevention and fight against fraud.

## üì£ What is our position on this matter?

We understand that for the success of the business model known as **RACHA (AM RACHA)**, all participating natural and legal persons must know and respect the anti-money laundering regulations that we have just outlined, given the importance of building a solid, sustainable, and credible business model.

In relation to the above, it is important to know that all natural persons who, acting on their own or on behalf of a third party, carry out any of the following movements must submit a prior declaration:

- Departure or entry into national territory of means of payment for an amount equal to or greater than 10,000 United States dollars or its equivalent in foreign currency.
- If a higher amount needs to be entered, a special declaration must be made at Customs, using form OM 2249A.

For its part, **means of payment** shall be understood as:

a) Banknotes and coins, both national and foreign. In the case of foreign currency, it can be understood that the equivalent value will be fixed at the time of its declaration by reference to the official exchange rates of the euro established by the European Central Bank.

b) Bearer bank checks denominated in any currency. Therefore, nominative checks are excluded from the obligation. This exclusion is logical: nominative checks are identified at all times by the issuing and receiving entity.

With regard to bearer checks, although it is possible to identify who issues and who collects them, they nevertheless present a risk in terms of the "chain of operations served by the instrument between issuance and collection."

c) Any other physical means, including electronic ones, conceived to be used as a means of payment to the bearer.

With this enumeration, it seems that the Legislator intends to leave the door open to possible payment instruments that may arise in the future within the obligation to declare, hence the very broad concept used, which (it must be emphasized) affects any physical or electronic means that can be used as a means of payment.

Similarly, if certain types of goods (such as jewelry, precious stones and metals, stamps or antique coins, or certain works of art or antiques that can be physically transported or mobilized) are accepted as a means of payment, the subject could consider themselves affected by the declaration obligation provided that these goods exceed said value. However, such goods are not legally considered means of payment. The FATF Recommendations of February 2012 are followed on this point.

Thus, said precept specifies that movements of negotiable instruments to the bearer, including monetary instruments such as traveler's checks, negotiable instruments, including checks, promissory notes and payment orders, whether drawn to the bearer, endorsed without restriction, drawn to the order of a fictitious beneficiary or in any other form by virtue of which ownership thereof is transferred upon delivery, and incomplete instruments (including checks, promissory notes and payment orders, signed but omitting the name of the beneficiary), will also be subject to the declaration obligation.

## üí° Final Note

Finally, and alluding to a reality of modern times, it is necessary to note that a particularly relevant role in the prevention of money laundering is the responsible treatment of transactions carried out using **crypto-assets**, with respect to which maximum diligence must be exercised in order to prevent situations constituting possible money laundering.
