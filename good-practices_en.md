## BEST PRACTICES INSTRUMENT FOR ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PREVENTION

FLORIDA, MARCH 1, 2024

It is important to note to all individuals or legal entities participating in the business model known as RACHA (AM RACHA) that it is imperative to comply with all national and community legislation on anti-money laundering prevention.

To this end, we provide you with this anti-money laundering prevention instrument.

Money laundering can be consensually defined as a process that essentially involves giving a lawful appearance to assets derived from criminal activity, making them appear as legally obtained; in other words, it involves integrating assets obtained through criminal offenses into the legal economic flow. Similarly, there is consensus in identifying three phases in this process, as commonly defined by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):

‚û¢ The first phase, known as placement, is characterized by transforming assets to avoid suspicion about their origin or to facilitate their handling.

‚û¢ The second phase, layering, aims to obscure the trail of the previous placement.

‚û¢ Finally, when the assets appear completely disconnected from their illicit origin, we reach the third stage, known as integration, where the assets are incorporated into the legal economic flow. It should be noted that not all money laundering cases involve all three stages; nor do they necessarily follow the described sequence. What is certain is that the more advanced the legitimization process, the more challenging its prosecution becomes.

Given this, it is necessary to emphasize that our independent distributors must be aware of Spanish and community legislation on anti-money laundering prevention:

# Legal Framework for Money Laundering in Florida

The legal framework for money laundering in Florida is outlined in Florida Statute Section 896.101, also known as the Florida Money Laundering Act. This statute classifies money laundering activities based on the amount of money involved and specifies the intent required for a conviction. The law prohibits:

- Financial transactions that promote organized crime  
- Transportation of monetary instruments or funds to promote organized crime  
- Conducting financial transactions involving proceeds from illegal activities

Illegal activities that typically generate funds subject to money laundering include white-collar crimes, drug trafficking, cybercrimes, and more. Penalties for money laundering in Florida are severe and escalate with the amount of money involved.

Florida's approach to penalizing money laundering is structured to reflect the severity of the offense, focusing on the amount laundered over a 12-month period. Penalties are classified as follows:

- **First-degree felony**: Transactions totaling $100,000 or more can result in up to 30 years in prison.  
- **Second-degree felony**: For transactions totaling between $20,000 and $100,000, the offender may face up to 15 years in prison.  
- **Third-degree felony**: Transactions exceeding $300 but less than $20,000 can lead to up to 5 years in prison.  

Beyond imprisonment, convicted individuals may face hefty fines, which can amount to $250,000 or double the value of the laundered amount for a first offense. For subsequent offenses, fines can rise to $500,000 or four times the value of the transaction, whichever is greater. Additionally, a civil fine of $25,000 or the value of the transactions, whichever is greater, may be imposed.

## üèõÔ∏è Federal Regulation

From a federal perspective, it is necessary to mention the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, also known as the "Bank Secrecy Act" (BSA), which dates back to the 1970s and was the first reference legislation formed to prevent criminals from hiding the origin of criminal proceeds through banks and other financial institutions. The law required financial institutions to cooperate with the government against suspected money laundering. The BSA is the most important regulation in the United States against money laundering. Banks and other financial institutions must ensure compliance with the obligations imposed by the BSA.

The BSA aims to aid in the fight against money laundering and ensure that banks and financial institutions are not used as tools to facilitate it. Under the BSA, entities must detect and monitor potential money laundering activities and report them to authorities for enforcement actions. The legislation also quickly became a tool to track and intercept terrorist financing.

The Bank Secrecy Act is administered by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which imposes various compliance obligations on financial institutions. To meet these obligations, senior management must ensure they are well-versed in the legislation.

To achieve BSA compliance, financial institutions must navigate a series of regulatory requirements focused on reporting to authorities, cooperating with them, and creating internal controls against money laundering. This process involves the following key considerations: an Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) compliance program and reporting and record-keeping requirements.

### üìå AML/CTF Compliance Program

The BSA requires financial institutions to develop an anti-money laundering (AML) program. An effective BSA-AML/CTF compliance program should be tailored to the unique needs of the financial institution it serves, including the risk profile it faces. The main elements of an AML/CTF compliance program are as follows:

- **Internal systems and controls**: An AML/CTF compliance program should be built around a set of written policies and procedures designed to help employees detect and control money laundering activities and financial crimes.  
- **Compliance officer**: A senior employee should be appointed to oversee the development and implementation of the institution's program. In addition to overseeing internal controls, the Compliance Officer is responsible for organizing independent audits and examinations of the institution's AML/CTF compliance program.  
- **BSA training**: Basic BSA-AML compliance training should be provided to all employees. Employees with higher levels of responsibility may require advanced training or certification.  
- **Independent audits**: A regular schedule of independent audits should be established to verify the ongoing effectiveness of an AML/CTF compliance program. Audits should be conducted by qualified third parties.  
- **Reporting and record-keeping**: The BSA entails numerous reporting and filing obligations with FinCEN, which relate to specific risk profiles.  

These obligations include:

- **Currency Transaction Reports (CTR)**: CTRs must be filed for cash transactions exceeding $10,000. This requirement pertains solely to the physical exchange of money (cash and paper) between individuals.  
- **Form 8300**: Certain businesses, such as car dealerships, art galleries, or insurance companies, that receive more than $10,000 in cash in a single transaction or in multiple related transactions within a 24-hour period, must file Form 8300.  
- **Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR)**: Transactions involving suspected violations of the BSA or terrorist financing activities totaling more than $5,000 must be detailed in a SAR. SARs can be filed voluntarily for suspicious transactions below the $5,000 threshold.  
- **Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR)**: An annual filing requirement for individuals who have foreign bank accounts totaling $10,000 or more. While the account holder generally files the FBAR, financial professionals filing on behalf of a client must register to file it as an institution.

## üîê Common Compliance Systems (KYC Utilities)

Obligated entities should strive to establish common systems (centralized or decentralized) to share customer due diligence information. These are known as "KYC utilities." The current regulations do not impose limitations that hinder the development of such tools, but the law provides certainty about their development and operation.

Undoubtedly, the use of these tools is a fundamental advancement. First, for customers, who will reduce the number of times they have to provide their information to the entities they contract with, facilitating and streamlining processes. But also, of course, it benefits the obligated entities by allowing a reduction in the costs associated with obtaining and updating basic due diligence information, generating greater homogeneity of the data obtained, and a more appropriate updating process.

However, their implementation will require a significant effort to standardize these due diligence processes for all participants in the common systems that may be created. On the other hand, it seems complex for such tools to replace the individualized approach by entities concerning higher-than-average risk customers, where the entities' risk appetite may lead to varying control intensities that hinder the standardization of criteria required by such systems.

## üßæ Financial Ownership Registry

On one hand, the assets subject to declaration are modified. Thus, safety deposit boxes and payment accounts are incorporated, and securities accounts are eliminated. As a result, and specifically due to the inclusion of payment accounts, the number of reporting entities is expanded, so that, along with credit institutions, payment institutions and electronic money institutions must also report their customers' payment accounts.

Finally, the access regime is modified, incorporating new authorities and expanding the access capacity of others that already had recognized access (the requirement for prior judicial or fiscal authorization for police access is eliminated). In all cases, however, the restricted purpose for access is maintained: investigation of money laundering and terrorist financing, which is only expanded in the case of actions to prevent and combat fraud.

## üì£ What is our stance on this matter?

We understand that for the success of the business model known as **RACHA (AM RACHA)**, all participating individuals and legal entities must be knowledgeable and respectful of the anti-money laundering regulations we have just outlined, given the importance of building a solid, sustainable, and credible business model.

In this regard, it is important to know that all individuals who, acting on their own behalf or on behalf of others, carry out any of the following movements must submit a prior declaration:

- Entry or exit from national territory of means of payment amounting to $10,000 or more in United States dollars or its equivalent in foreign currency.  
- If a higher amount is to be deposited, a special declaration must be made at Customs using form OM 2249A.  

For this purpose, **means of payment** are understood as:

a) Paper money and coins, both national and foreign. In the case of foreign currency, it can be understood that the equivalent will be set at the time of declaration by reference to the official exchange rates of the euro established by the European Central Bank.

b) Bearer bank checks denominated in any currency. Therefore, nominative checks are excluded from the obligation. This exclusion is logical: nominative checks are identified at all times by the issuing and receiving entity.

Regarding bearer checks, although it is possible to identify who issues and who cashes them, they present a risk concerning the "chain of operations the instrument serves between issuance and cashing."

c) Any other physical means, including electronic ones, designed to be used as a bearer payment method.

With this enumeration, it seems that the Legislator intends to leave the door open to possible payment instruments that may arise in the future
